# React Exercise 1 - User Management
----------

## App Description
----------
This application manages users with CRUD operations. It displays users in a clean table with each row having its own edit and delete operations. This app also implements data persistence using local storage.

## How to Use?
----------
1. Click the `Add User` button to show the collapsible User Form. Fill out all the required fields and follow the instructions when an error message displays to resolve it.
    - Submitting the form brings up a modal to confirm addition of user
2. The `Delete All Users` button is disabled when there are no users. 
3. The `Edit` and `Delete` button for each user is found in the Actions column of the table.
    - Clicking `Edit` will bring up a modal with prefilled data and lets you edit all the details of the user.

## Key Learnings and Takeaways ðŸ§ 
- I learned about basic data sanitation and validation on the client side.
- With good practice and adhering to web standards, the frontend will have no problem integrating to a server in terms of security and data anomalies.
- A significant challenge is the presentation of data and intuitiveness of the system. Overcoming it lead to a better usability of the application.
